# Components

These examples show basic usage of what [Bootstrap components](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/) look like in FSO Bootstrap, including any extra color options and varieties of the default controls. Most components include the bulk of bootstrap's normal documentation for ease-of-reading and for testing changes. Be sure to check the full documentation of these components, see bootstrap's components documentation (linked above) or use the link provided on each page.

## New Components

FSO Bootstrap includes several components not included by Bootstrap. As such, their complete documentation is found here on this site. New components include:

- Font Awesome Icons
- UA Branding Icons
- Background Wrappers
- Callouts?
