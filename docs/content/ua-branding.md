# University of Arizona Branding Colors

<p class="lead">These docs introduce the UA color palatte as well as our FSO Bootstrap Palatte (a subset of the UA branding colors with some additional options), as well as the many utilities available to implement these colors.</p>

These colors are pulled from the [UA branding guidelines](https://brand.arizona.edu/ua-color-palette). The UA color palatte is expansive and all the colors listed below are available for use via our [text](#text-color) and [background](#background-color) utilites (examples will be shown below). However, only a small subset of these colors are available for use in components throughout FSO Bootstrap. FSO Bootstrap simplifies the number of colors to streamline the brand further and uses more developer-friendly terms such as `primary`, `accent`, etc.
