This documentation site is primarily for demonstrating the look and feel of our customizations to Bootstrap. Every documentation section will include a button which links you to the Bootstrap documentation on the same topic. There is no guarantee that documentation on specific bootstrap components or content are fully up to date on this site, so be sure to check out the [Bootstrap documentation site](https://getbootstrap.com/) as it is the source of truth whenever something isn't fully explained _or_ isn't fully functioning as it should. 

There are several things that are unique to FSO Bootstrap, which are noted in these docs. A non-exhaustive list includes:

- [Font Awesome Icons](./components/font-awesome-icons.md)
- [UA Branding Icons](./components/ua-brand-icons.md)
- Addition of `.brand-accent` and other [UA branding colors](./content/ua-branding.md) (also see [Colors](./content/colors.md)) as well as the concept of `.brand-light` and `.brand-dark`
- [Additional Jumbotron's](./components/jumbotron.md#variations)
- Specific instructions and classes for meeting strict UA branding guidelines for text (see [here](./content/typography.md#meeting-ua-branding-guidelines))
- [Triangle lists](./content/typography.md#triangle)
